Analysts jump between tools, manually stitch together context, and make judgment calls under pressure, often for hundreds of alerts a week. Too much of their work is slow, repetitive, and error-prone. We're here to change that. \n\nSocratix gives fraud and risk teams AI coworkers that investigate alerts in real time, replacing manual reviews with fast, explainable decisions. Socratix agents plug into existing workflows and reason across signals just like human analysts to help teams reduce fraud losses, minimize false positives, and scale operations without scaling headcount.\n\nWe've seen this problem firsthand. At DoorDash, Riya helped save $30M+ a year by building smarter fraud detection and investigation tooling, and at Unit21, she built products for analysts that made them 3X faster. We're able to build and sell enterprise-grade software. At Cruise, Satya built scalable AI systems powering petabyte-scale data, and at LinkedIn, he built enterprise products from 0 to 1 generating $50M+ in incremental revenue. Now, the two of us are teaming up to eliminate the manual toil in fraud and risk.\n\nWe're obsessed with fraud, LLMs, real-world automation, and the messy edge cases traditional ML has trouble handling. We believe that every fraud analyst should have an AI coworker - and the future of fraud will involve combining human-level reasoning with machine-speed execution.",

Ozai monitors all incoming messages (emails, phone calls, voicemails, whatsapp, fax etc.), figures out if it's an order, learns each customer's habits, shorthand, and favorite products, picks up on any prep notes, and enters it straight into the existing ERP. It'll even go back to the customers on your behalf when it's not sure about something, clarify things and carry on working. \n\nThe more it sees, the smarter it gets.",

    "About": "Flick is an AI filmmaking software that lets people create Hollywood-level short films completely using AI end-to-end.\n\nThere are many AI tools that can give you 8-second casual clips to post on social media, but when it comes to creating truly high-quality films with coherent storylines, consistent characters, and cinematic aesthetics, they don’t come close due to their lack of flexibility, creative control, and fragmented creative flow.\n\nFounded by an award-winning filmmaker and a founding engineer at Instagram, Flick defines an interface specifically designed for native AI filmmaking that feels natural and enables end-to-end creative flows. Think of Flick as Figma for AI filmmaking.\n\nThere are 4 complete AI short films created using Flick that got 20+ awards in international film festivals already and our early creator residency community are generating several AI short films every week.\n\nWe are also building a community where we produce our own AI films as well as collaborating with other well-known filmmakers to share their “behind-the-scenes” workflows as resuable templates to inspire users in our community. We not only build product, we also build world-class content.\n\nThe whole film industry will be revolutionized by AI and our goal is to be “the product” that defines this category.",

    "About": "TheHog.ai is the first predictive intelligence engine for growth. We don't just find leads; we predict your next customer before they enter the market.\n\nTheHog.ai maps your ICP, channels, and opportunities across the internet, monitors competitors, communities, keywords, and turns signals into ranked actionable game plans.\n\nThe future of sales isn't a static dashboard; it is a living, autonomous command center. TheHog.ai gives a single operator the power of an entire sales and marketing teams by compressing weeks of research into minutes of execution.\n\nThe Hog Mind & Global Graph At our core is \"The Hog Mind\": a proprietary Contributory Global Graph that fuses real-time social listening with advanced identity resolution. Unlike traditional enrichment tools that rely on stale databases, The Hog monitors millions of live conversations across the internet to identify high-frequency intent signals. This creates a self-reinforcing data flywheel that ranks opportunities and triggers autonomous engagement workflows instantly.\n\nWhat We Do:\n\nPredictive Buying Intelligence: We map the \"Global Graph\" of customer nodes to surface opportunities before competitors know they exist.\n\nAutonomous Engagement: An army of AI agents that don't just draft, but identify, verify, and engage with customers across LinkedIn, Reddit, and X.\n\nDeep Data Enrichment: We bridge the gap between anonymous social signals and verified contact data, creating a holistic view of your market.\n\nThe Data Flywheel: A bottom-up network where every user interaction cleans and verifies our dataset, creating a defensive moat that gets smarter with every query.\n\nThe Result: Win your customers before it’s even a competition",

    "About": "DiligenceSquared delivers AI-powered market due diligence for investment decisions - like the $500k McKinsey reports, but automated, auditable, and at a fraction of the cost.\n\nWhen Private Equity funds evaluate deals, they pay firms like McKinsey, BCG, and Bain $500K-$1M for market due diligence. The process takes weeks, and the output is a static PowerPoint that's impossible to audit. A single large-cap PE fund can spend >$30M annually on this and the total market is $10B per year.\n\nOur AI agents conduct expert interviews and synthesize insights with every claim linked to source transcripts. No black box, no \"trust me\" slides, and no 10x mark-up for human labor.\n\nFrederik bought these reports as a Principal at Blackstone. Soren sold them as a Principal at BCG. Harshil is a repeat founder and former Software Engineer at Google. We've seen both sides and know what matters in due diligence - and now we automate it.\n\nOur clients already include 8 leading private equity funds with over $2.4 trillion in combined AUM.",
