Today, fraud and risk teams at fintechs and banks are overwhelmed. Analysts jump between tools, manually stitch together context, and make judgment calls under pressure, often for hundreds of alerts a week. Too much of their work is slow, repetitive, and error-prone. We're here to change that. 

Socratix gives fraud and risk teams AI coworkers that investigate alerts in real time, replacing manual reviews with fast, explainable decisions. Socratix agents plug into existing workflows and reason across signals just like human analysts to help teams reduce fraud losses, minimize false positives, and scale operations without scaling headcount.

We've seen this problem firsthand. At DoorDash, Riya helped save $30M+ a year by building smarter fraud detection and investigation tooling, and at Unit21, she built products for analysts that made them 3X faster. We're able to build and sell enterprise-grade software. At Cruise, Satya built scalable AI systems powering petabyte-scale data, and at LinkedIn, he built enterprise products from 0 to 1 generating $50M+ in incremental revenue. Now, the two of us are teaming up to eliminate the manual toil in fraud and risk.

We're obsessed with fraud, LLMs, real-world automation, and the messy edge cases traditional ML has trouble handling. We believe that every fraud analyst should have an AI coworker - and the future of fraud will involve combining human-level reasoning with machine-speed execution.",Riya Jagetia,https://twitter.com/RiyaJagetia,https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/socratix-ai/jobs,,

We’re taking a new approach by building everything from the ground up for AI.

✨ Try building an app at floot.com

Existing AI app builders fall short of enabling non-coders to build real, serious apps. They often:
- Break down when building anything more than a prototype or toy app
- Have non-coders stuck with errors they don’t understand
- Require non-coders to handle multiple services designed for developers (e.g. for backend, database, hosting, etc)

The fundamental problem: these AI app builders just cobble together existing developer tools and slap AI on top, but these tools were designed for humans and not for AI.

The result? Non-coders get excited, start building, hit a wall, and then abandon their projects.

Floot is purpose-built for AI. Our secret sauce:

1) Instead of reusing a coding framework designed for humans, we created a specialized framework that dictates how AI should write code and how the code runs on our infrastructure. This allows us to enforce best practices, detect errors earlier, and give the best feedback to the AI. As a result, Floot can write better code and fix issues more effectively.

2) Floot has the entire tech stack built-in (backend, database, hosting, etc) so building and managing an app feels seamless, especially for non-coders. And because we control every layer of the stack, we can optimize each layer for AI-first coding.

Because of this, non-coders can get more done with less time and prompting. They can finally build serious apps that work, instead of getting stuck in frustrating error loops and then abandoning their projects.

We also built a highly scalable hosting system directly on AWS so Floot apps can handle real traffic and business demands. This means non-coders can build, deploy, and scale their apps on a single platform seamlessly.

Plus, Floot is really fun to use! Try building an app at floot.com",Yujian Yao,https://x.com/yyjhao,https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/floot/jobs,,

We launched this year in the middle of tax season and quickly processed hundreds of returns, earning thousands in ARR, and since tax season we've been growing customers by >30% month-over-month. We've completely automated over 25% of the return process so far and developed a proprietary vision model that beats incumbent scanning technology by almost 2x on accuracy - jumping from 50% field-level accuracy to 89%, approaching the quality of their expensive human-verified service at 92%.

The opportunity is massive - there are 80M US personal tax returns filed via professionals annually, in a $2B outsourcing market where individual CPA firms currently pay $100k-$1M per year for inferior services. We're positioned to capture significant market share by offering better accuracy & document coverage, instant processing, and superior user experience.

We've built this kind of software before, we've worked together for years (and even lived together), we've built products to $10M ARR before, and we have the grit to outwork anyone in this space.",Patrick Fay,https://linkedin.com/in/patrick-fay-5418a822,https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/magnetic/jobs,,
